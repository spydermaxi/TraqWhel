TINT - A Tyre Inventory & Tracking App for Freight Transport businesses looking to track tyre records and usages.

Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

A small/medium frieght transport business in Malaysia is looking for options to track their tyre usage and serial number trackings in order to keep track of they tyre consumption rates as well as to track any possible theft on their tyres.

The business is a traditional and family run business, and employees are not tech savy enough to maintain a CRM subscription and get trained on using CRM software online. They use basic office tools to perform manual entries and retrievals

Thus this project is born, to help businesses with low digital maturity, to track their tyre inventory.
